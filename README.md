This is one of my cpp practices I did while I learning. In advance, I want to say a few words about the code. First you need to fill first-class for proper code-run. I know it is kind of nonsense but I'll be honest I didn't write to write more. I obtained the experience that I need. You can check it too for your self-learn.
